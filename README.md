Script for "Inference in Multiple Small Dynamic Networks"

## Step (1)

- pgg_data: Data collected from Public Goods Game. Each network is a igraph object.

- pgg_adj: Adjacency matrices of "pgg_data".

## Step (2)

- pgg_plus_data: Formation network data collected from Public Goods Game. Each network is a igraph object. You can also make this by "plus_network.R".

- pgg_plus_adj: Adjacency matrices of "pgg_plus_data". You can also make this by "plus_network.R".

## Step (3)

- pgg_minus_data: Persistence network data collected from Public Goods Game. Each network is a igraph object. You can also make this by "minus_network.R".

- pgg_minus_adj: Adjacency matrices of "pgg_minus_data". You can also make this by "minus_network.R".

## Step (4)

Run "main.py". This script will generate the results of the paper.
